# 📊 Student Performance Prediction

This project uses machine learning models to predict student academic outcomes based on various social, behavioral, and school-related features. It applies multiple classification algorithms and resampling techniques (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance and evaluate model performance.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To predict whether a student will **pass (1)** or **fail (0)** using historical student data, leveraging multiple machine learning classifiers and evaluating them based on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

## 🚀 Streamlit Web App

The project includes a user-friendly **Streamlit app** to predict a student's performance.

### Features:
- 📋 Input student features like study time, failures, family support, alcohol consumption, etc.
- 🔄 Choose from multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, or KNN.
- 🎯 Predict if the student is likely to **pass** or **fail**.
- 📈 Get probability of passing if supported by the model.
